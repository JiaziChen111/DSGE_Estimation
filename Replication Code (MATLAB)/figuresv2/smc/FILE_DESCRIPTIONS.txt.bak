FILE DESCRIPTIONS

These graphs show the output of sequential monte carlo algorithm. 

To propogate the particles forward, I use RWMH. Number of particles is 2*1024, 500 stages, with bending coefficient 3. Target acceptance rate is .25

Both plots are waterfall plots. For N_phi=1, the draws are from the prior, culminiting is N_phi=500 when draws are from the posterior.
