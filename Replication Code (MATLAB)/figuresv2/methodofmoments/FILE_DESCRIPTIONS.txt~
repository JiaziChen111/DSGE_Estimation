Method of Moments estimation of DSGE model. 

MM - performs the matching based on simulated expected VAR parameters. Expected parameters are found by simulating 100 datasets from the DSGE model (at the given parameters) and estimating the VAR(2). Then average over the 100 datasets to get expected VAR parameters. Red (solid) line is true value, Black (dashed) line is sample size 200, Blue (dotted) line is sample size 80.

MM_dsge - does the same as above but instead of simulating to find expected VAR coefficients, uses the VAR implied by the dsge model (population values). Red (solid) line is true value, Black (dashed) line is sample size 200, Blue (dotted) line is sample size 80.

Algorithm for estimation is:
1.) Simulate dataset of size N, estimate VAR(2) and store coefficients. I use N = 80 and 200.
2.) For a range of zeta values, simulate K datasets based on state-space representation of DSGE model. For each of the K, compute VAR(2) coefficients, and average across the K. Store the zeta value that minimizes the distance between the true data and expected parameters. I use K = 100.
3.) For a range of zeta values, compute the expected VAR(2) coefficients, based on the VAR approximation of the DSGE model (infinite data). Store the values of zeta that minimizes the difference between the true data and expected parameters.
4.) Repeat 1-3 many times. I do 30 repetitions.
