FILE DESCRIPTIONS


samp_distr_mle - sampling distribution of Maximum Likelihood
estimator found via the Kalman filter. Blue (dotted) line is sample
size 80 while Black (dashed) line is sample size 200. Red (solid)
is true value. Note that for this one, the range of zeta was from
.45 - .95 as opposed to .2-.95. Zeta values too small introduced
singularities.

likelihood - the likelihood function for a single dataset
