FILE DESCRIPTIONS


Pattern of filteredXfrom_Y:

X is 1 or 3, Y is 1 or 3.
X refers to the variable being filtered. 1 is phi_t, 3 is z_t.
Y refers to the number of observables used in filtering. 1 is only log-output and 3 is output, labor and inflation.

Black (dotted) line is true value, blue (dashed) line is filtered value and grey box is 90% confidence interval.


Particle_filtered100_1-4: Filtered variable (1 is phi_t, 2 is
lambda_t, 3 is z_t and 4 is eps_R_t) based on Particle filter. We
use all four observables to perform filtering and introduce
measurement error with diagonal covariance matrix with 1e-4 on
diagonals. Red (solid) line is Kalman Filtered values, blue
(dashed) is particle filter based on 100 particles.

Particle_L_together - Sum of Likelihood error between exact
(kalman) likelihood and approximate (particle) likelihood. Blue
(solid) line is 100 particles, red (dotted) is 200 particles and
yellow (dashed) is 500 particles.

Particle_likelihood100 - Time series of likelihood values. Red
(solid) line is exact (kalman) likelihood, blue (dashed) is
particle filtered approximate likelihood. Particle filtering uses
100 particles.
