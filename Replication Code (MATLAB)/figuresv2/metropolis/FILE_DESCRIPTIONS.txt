FILE DESCRIPTIONS

For all plots, I use 7,500 burn-in samples and 30,000 draws from
the posterior. The initial draw is from the prior. Candidates are
drawn Random Walk with variance the inverse variance of posterior
mode. c is .075 and acceptance probability is .55

Plots are for sigma_phi and zeta_p, which are indicated by graph
names.

density - Posterior density (after burn-in). Blue (solid) line is
posterior density, Black (dashed) line is prior density and grey
(dotted) line is posterior mean.

draw - Raw draws for all 40,000 draws.

recursive_mean - recursive mean of draws after burn-in.
