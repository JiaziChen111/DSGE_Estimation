%NOTE: I changed the kalman function to reflect the linear model (deleted R and transposed A)
		     dsgeliki to use our data and model
		     prior to reflect our priors

There are 7 main files in the folder. 

1) Candidate.m                 : It computes the candidate density for Metropolis-Hastings algorith, 
                                 The output (MH_candidate.mat) is saved in the folder ``Matfiles".
	 
2) MetropolisHastings.m        : It runs the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. It save the posterior draws 
                                 and logposterior density (mhdraws.mat) in the folder "Matfiles". The file 
                                 produces some diagnostic graph.

3) VarianceDecomposition.m     : After loading mhdraws.mat, the file computes and graph the contribution 
                                 of technology and preference shocks to the variance of detrended GDP and 
                                 hours worked (from horizon 1 to horizon Nhor).

4) ImpulseResponse.m           : After loading mhdraws.mat, the file computes and graph the response of  
                                 selected variables to technology and preference shocks.

5) PosteriorPredictiveChecks.m : After loading mhdraws.mat, the file computes and graphs posterior predictive 
                                 checks for GDP growth and hours worked.

6) Forecasting.m               : After loading mhdraws.mat, the file computes and graphs DSGE based forecasts  
                                 (median and 90% credible set) for output and hours worked.

7) marginal_data_density.m     : After loading mhdraws.mat, the file computes the marginal data density. The 
                                 marginal data density in the workspace is the variable mdd.
 

These files use a number of procedures collected in the folder "Mfiles". The most relevant files are


	a) model_solution.m  : Takes as inputs the vector of structural parameters. Returns the coefficient 
                               matrices of the log-linear approximate solution of the DSGE model. Please, 
                               refer to Sims () for details on the procedure.

	b) sysmat.m          : Takes as inputs the solution of the DSGE model and the vector of structural parameters.
                               Returns the matrices for the state space representation. 

	c) kalman.m          : Takes as inputs the state space matrices. Returns the likelihood function and the 
                               filtered states. 

	d) dsgeliki.m        : Takes as inputs the vector of structural parameters. Returns the value of the 
                               log-likelihood function.

	e) prior.m           : Takes as inputs the vector of structural parameters. Returns the value of the
                               log-prior. Modify this file in case you need to change the prior distribution.  
	


The folder contains two additional subfolders: "LRE" and "Optimization Routines". These two folders collect files
to solve the linear rational expectation model and to find the posterior mode.
